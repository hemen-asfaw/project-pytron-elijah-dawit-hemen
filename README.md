Reminder: Ruth is also a part of this group 

The python codes are in the folder 1010 final project "iggys_run.py"

The game has been made a number of times, so we were able to find different guides on how to structure it.
We worked with the TA's (Aidan D. and Julian) for debugging and on how to understand the previously made codes to generate 
our own on lines of code.  

We worked in pairs for a majority of the project. The pairs were Ruth and Hemen, Dawit and Elijah
Hemen and Ruth worked on building the classes, for Iggy and the Obstacles, adding sounds and details on the menu screen.    
Elijah and Dawit worked on the main function and the menu screen. 
We all ended up taking shifts debugging and editing each others codes with the help of the TA's. 

The videos below are the ones we referenced to most

Main problems we faced (which are further explained in the short we made):

1. With making the jump function for Iggy 

2. Figuring out how to quit the game 

3. get.rect function 

4. having the background appear behind Iggy instead of in front (since it covered Iggy and the obstacles)

We had to restart the project a couple of times mainly because we had significant glitches with the jump function. 
Once we were able to get Iggy to jump at the speed we wanted it was much easier to continue with the coding.
